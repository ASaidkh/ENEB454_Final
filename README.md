Platformer game using pixel art drawn by Jaelyn Hui run on the DE1-SoC board. The VGA driver used was developed for this project. The audio and acceloremeter drivers used are the in-built drivers provided with the Linux distribution for the DE1-SoC board. The game has up (jump) and down (duck) inputs through the pushbuttons. There are four types of obstacles, crystal from the top that requires ducking, a small mushroom and cat obstacles that require jumping over, and a pond obstacle that requires shaking the board until a certain threshold is reached to escape.
